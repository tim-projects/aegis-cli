- **Color countdown (less than 10s red):** Implement visual cue for OTP countdown when less than 10 seconds remaining.
- **Interactive Group Filtering (Ctrl+G):** Add interactive functionality to filter by group using `Ctrl+G` key press, leveraging existing search filter function to select a group, then displaying only relevant entries.
- **Enhanced Clipboard Integration and User Feedback:** Refine clipboard functionality to include configurable clipboard tools (e.g., for Xorg/Wayland via `config.json`) and display the message "Press <Enter> to copy the OTP code to the clipboard." when an item is revealed. This message should only appear if a clipboard tool is configured.
